# Visitors-Tracking-Tool-realtime
Your program is designed to track and record various information about website visitors in real-time, including their IP address, device type, browser, date and time of access, city, country, and the specific page they are currently browsing. This information is useful for website owners and administrators to gain insights into visitor behavior and preferences.

This program will send all your data from your website to your discord server using **WEBHOOKS**

The real-time nature of the program ensures that the data captured is current and accurate, allowing for quick response to any issues or opportunities. This means that website owners can view the current visitor activity and respond immediately if necessary.

Overall, your program provides a valuable tool for website analytics and optimization, enabling website owners to gain insights into visitor behavior and make data-driven decisions to improve the user experience and achieve business goals.
